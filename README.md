# SwerveBot-2023
##  6194's SwerveBot code for SDS MK4i L1 with NEO's, NAVx, PathPlanner 2023 and PhotonVision.
### Modified from Team 3512's modifications of Team 364's [BaseFalconSwerve](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve) project to utilize __NEO motors__

Therefore, their [instructions](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve#setting-constants) on modifiying the constants to fit your robot will also work on this repo as well.

__Status as of 1/29/2023 - Drivetrain is fully functional. Have not yet tested PathPlanner or PhotoVision.__

### Configurations
- Works with a swerve drive with __NEO brushless motors__, __Spark Max motor controllers__, __CTRE CANCoders__, and __NavX__.
- Drive and steer ratios are configured for the __SDS MK4i L1 modules__, but can be easily be adapted to other modules.
